### syntax

any code is kept between the script tags , that has two attributes `language` and `type`

- language
   - recent versions of HTML has ruled out the use of this attribute
- Type
   - reccomended to indicate the scripting language language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascript".

```
<html>
 <body>
  <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
    varx;
    x=5;
  </script>
 </body>
 </html>
```

## Javascript statements 


- they are composed of `value` `operators`
