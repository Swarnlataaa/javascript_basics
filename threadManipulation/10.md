### Final Project: Multi-threaded Task Processing System

#### Project Overview

In this final project, participants will apply the concepts learned throughout the course to build a multi-threaded task processing system in JavaScript. The system will leverage Web Workers, asynchronous programming, and shared memory to efficiently handle concurrent tasks.

#### Project Modules

### Module 1: Setting Up the Project

**Objective:**

- Set up the project structure and initialize necessary files.

**Tasks:**

1. Create project folders and files.
2. Initialize a package.json file.
3. Install any necessary dependencies (e.g., webpack for bundling).

### Module 2: Task Definition and Web Worker Creation

**Objective:**

- Define the structure of tasks to be processed.
- Create Web Workers to handle the execution of tasks in parallel.

**Tasks:**

1. Define the structure of a task object (e.g., task ID, task data).
2. Create a Web Worker script that receives and processes tasks.
3. Implement message passing between the main thread and Web Workers.

### Module 3: Shared Memory and Atomics

**Objective:**

- Implement shared memory using SharedArrayBuffer.
- Use Atomics to perform atomic operations for synchronization.

**Tasks:**

1. Set up a SharedArrayBuffer for shared memory.
2. Implement atomic operations using the Atomics object.
3. Share data between the main thread and Web Workers using shared memory.

### Module 4: Task Queue and Processing Logic

**Objective:**

- Design a task queue for managing incoming tasks.
- Implement the logic for processing tasks in the main thread.

**Tasks:**

1. Create a task queue to manage incoming tasks.
2. Implement logic to enqueue tasks and distribute them to Web Workers.
3. Design the processing logic for tasks in the main thread.

### Module 5: Error Handling and Completion Tracking

**Objective:**

- Implement error handling mechanisms.
- Track the completion status of tasks.

**Tasks:**

1. Implement error handling for both the main thread and Web Workers.
2. Track the completion status of tasks and handle task completion events.

### Module 6: User Interface (Optional)

**Objective:**

- Create a simple user interface to interact with the task processing system.

**Tasks:**

1. Develop a basic UI for users to input tasks.
2. Display the status and results of processed tasks.

#### Project Completion

Participants should demonstrate their multi-threaded task processing system by processing a set of sample tasks, showcasing concurrent execution using Web Workers and efficient communication through shared memory. The project should highlight error handling, completion tracking, and an optional user interface for better interaction.

#### Assessment

- Code quality and organization.
- Effective use of Web Workers, shared memory, and asynchronous programming.
- Error handling and task completion tracking.
- User interface design and user experience (if applicable).

#### Note

Adjust the complexity of tasks and the depth of UI based on the participants' skill levels and objectives. Encourage participants to explore additional features or optimizations based on their interests and capabilities.
