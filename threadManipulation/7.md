### 3.1 Introduction to Web Workers

#### Overview of Web Workers and Their Purpose

**Web Workers:**

- Web Workers are a way to run JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main thread.
- They enable parallel execution, allowing certain tasks to be offloaded to another thread, preventing UI blocking.

**Purpose:**

1. **Parallel Processing:**
   - Perform computationally intensive tasks without affecting the responsiveness of the user interface.
2. **Asynchronous Operations:**
   - Handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data, without blocking the main thread.
3. **Multithreading:**
   - Introduce multithreading in web applications by running code concurrently in separate threads.

### Differences Between Web Workers and the Main Thread

1. **Single vs. Multi-threaded:**
   - The main thread is single-threaded, handling UI and JavaScript execution. Web Workers introduce multi-threading for parallel processing.

2. **Access to DOM:**
   - Web Workers do not have direct access to the DOM. They run in a separate context, preventing direct manipulation of the DOM.

3. **Communication:**
   - Communication between the main thread and Web Workers happens through a message-passing mechanism.

4. **No UI Blocking:**
   - Unlike the main thread, Web Workers do not directly impact the user interface and prevent UI blocking.

### 3.2 Creating and Using Web Workers

#### Creating a Web Worker and Communicating with the Main Thread

**main.js (Main Thread):**

```javascript
// Creating a Web Worker
const myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');

// Sending data to the Worker
const dataToSend = { message: 'Data from main thread', value: 42 };
myWorker.postMessage(dataToSend);

// Handling messages from the Worker
myWorker.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Message received from worker:', event.data);
};
```

**worker.js (Web Worker):**

```javascript
// Handling messages from the main thread
onmessage = (event) => {
  const receivedData = event.data;
  console.log('Data received in worker:', receivedData);

  // Sending data back to the main thread
  postMessage({ message: 'Data from worker', value: receivedData.value * 2 });
};
```

This example demonstrates how to create a Web Worker, send data from the main thread to the worker, and handle messages received from the worker.

#### Handling Messages and Data Transfer Between the Main Thread and a Web Worker

**main.js (Main Thread):**

```javascript
// Creating a Web Worker
const myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');

// Sending data to the Worker
const dataToSend = { message: 'Data from main thread', value: 42 };
myWorker.postMessage(dataToSend);

// Handling messages from the Worker
myWorker.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Message received from worker:', event.data);
};
```

**worker.js (Web Worker):**

```javascript
// Handling messages from the main thread
onmessage = (event) => {
  const receivedData = event.data;
  console.log('Data received in worker:', receivedData);

  // Sending data back to the main thread
  postMessage({ message: 'Data from worker', value: receivedData.value * 2 });
};
```

Communication between the main thread and the Web Worker occurs through the `postMessage` method and the `onmessage` event.

### 3.3 Shared Workers

#### Understanding Shared Workers for Shared State Among Multiple Browsing Contexts

**sharedWorker.js (Shared Worker):**

```javascript
// Handling messages from multiple browsing contexts
onconnect = (event) => {
  const port = event.ports[0];

  port.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = event.data;
    console.log('Data received in shared worker:', data);

    // Processing data and sending it back to the browsing context
    const result = data.value * 2;
    port.postMessage({ message: 'Data from shared worker', result });
  };
};
```

In this example, the `onconnect` event is used to handle connections from multiple browsing contexts, and each context communicates through its dedicated port.

Shared Workers are useful for scenarios where multiple browsing contexts (e.g., tabs or iframes) need to share a common state or perform coordinated tasks.
