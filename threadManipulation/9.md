### 5.1 SharedArrayBuffer

#### Introduction to SharedArrayBuffer for Shared Memory

**SharedArrayBuffer:**

- `SharedArrayBuffer` is an object in JavaScript that represents a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer, similar to `ArrayBuffer`.
- It allows multiple threads or workers to share a common memory space, enabling efficient communication and coordination.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Main Thread or Worker 1
const sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(16); // 16 bytes

// Accessing the shared memory
const intArray = new Int32Array(sharedBuffer);
intArray[0] = 42;
```

In this example, `sharedBuffer` is a shared memory space accessible by multiple threads or workers.

#### Atomics and Atomic Operations for Synchronization

**Atomics:**

- The `Atomics` object provides atomic operations that ensure certain operations are executed atomically, without interruption.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Worker 1
onmessage = (event) => {
  const sharedBuffer = event.data;
  const intArray = new Int32Array(sharedBuffer);

  // Atomic operation (add 1 to the value at index 0)
  Atomics.add(intArray, 0, 1);

  // Send back the modified shared memory
  postMessage(sharedBuffer);
};
```

In this example, the `Atomics.add` operation ensures that the addition to the shared memory occurs atomically, preventing race conditions.

### 5.2 Locks and Semaphores

#### Overview of Locks and Semaphores for Managing Access to Shared Resources

**Locks:**

- A lock is a synchronization mechanism used to enforce exclusive access to a shared resource. Only one thread can hold the lock at a time.

**Semaphores:**

- A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that controls access to a shared resource with a counter. It can allow multiple threads to access the resource simultaneously up to a certain limit.

#### Implementing Locks and Semaphores in JavaScript

**Lock Implementation:**

```javascript
class Lock {
  constructor() {
    this.isLocked = false;
  }

  acquire() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      const attemptAcquire = () => {
        if (!this.isLocked) {
          this.isLocked = true;
          resolve();
        } else {
          setTimeout(attemptAcquire, 10);
        }
      };

      attemptAcquire();
    });
  }

  release() {
    this.isLocked = false;
  }
}
```

**Semaphore Implementation:**

```javascript
class Semaphore {
  constructor(initialCount) {
    this.count = initialCount;
    this.waitQueue = [];
  }

  acquire() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      const attemptAcquire = () => {
        if (this.count > 0) {
          this.count--;
          resolve();
        } else {
          this.waitQueue.push(resolve);
        }
      };

      attemptAcquire();
    });
  }

  release() {
    if (this.waitQueue.length > 0) {
      const resolve = this.waitQueue.shift();
      resolve();
    } else {
      this.count++;
    }
  }
}
```

**Lock Usage:**

```javascript
// Using the Lock
const myLock = new Lock();

async function exampleFunction() {
  await myLock.acquire();
  try {
    // Critical section (exclusive access to shared resource)
    // ...
  } finally {
    myLock.release();
  }
}
```

**Semaphore Usage:**

```javascript
// Using the Semaphore
const mySemaphore = new Semaphore(2); // Allow up to 2 concurrent access

async function exampleFunction() {
  await mySemaphore.acquire();
  try {
    // Critical section (limited concurrent access to shared resource)
    // ...
  } finally {
    mySemaphore.release();
  }
}
```

These implementations demonstrate basic lock and semaphore mechanisms in JavaScript. Locks and semaphores are fundamental tools for managing access to shared resources in a concurrent environment, preventing race conditions and ensuring orderly access.
