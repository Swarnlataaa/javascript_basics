### What are Events?

In web development, events are interactions or occurrences that happen in the browser, typically triggered by the user or the browser itself. These events can include user actions (such as clicks, key presses, or mouse movements) or changes in the browser's state (like the completion of loading a page). Events play a crucial role in creating interactive and dynamic web applications.

### Common DOM Events

Here are some common DOM events:

1. **Click Event:** Triggered when a mouse click occurs.

2. **Submit Event:** Triggered when a form is submitted.

3. **Change Event:** Triggered when the value of an input element changes.

4. **Mouseover Event:** Triggered when the mouse pointer is moved over an element.

5. **Mouseout Event:** Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves an element.

6. **Keydown, Keyup, and Keypress Events:** Triggered when a key is pressed, released, or pressed and released, respectively.

7. **Load Event:** Triggered when a resource (such as an image or a script) finishes loading.

8. **Unload Event:** Triggered when the user navigates away from a page.

### Event Handlers and Listeners

**Event Handlers:**

An event handler is a function that specifies what should happen in response to a specific event. In HTML, event handlers can be assigned directly as attributes of HTML tags, like this:

```html
<button onclick="handleButtonClick()">Click me</button>

<script>
  function handleButtonClick() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  }
</script>
```

In this example, the `onclick` attribute specifies the event handler function `handleButtonClick()` that will be executed when the button is clicked.

**Event Listeners:**

Event listeners are a more flexible and preferred way to handle events in JavaScript. They allow you to attach multiple functions to a single event and provide better separation of concerns.

```html
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>

<script>
  // Using addEventListener to attach a click event listener
  const buttonElement = document.getElementById('myButton');
  buttonElement.addEventListener('click', handleButtonClick);

  function handleButtonClick() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  }
</script>
```

In this example, the `addEventListener` method is used to attach a `click` event listener to the button. The `handleButtonClick` function will be executed when the button is clicked.

Using event listeners is considered best practice because it allows for cleaner and more maintainable code, especially when dealing with multiple events or dynamic changes in the DOM.
