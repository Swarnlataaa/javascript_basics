### 4.3 Throttling and Debouncing

#### Strategies for Controlling the Rate of Execution of a Function

**Throttling:**

- Throttling limits the rate at which a function is executed. It ensures that the function is called at most once in a specified time interval.
- Useful for scenarios where a function should not be called more frequently than a defined threshold.

**Debouncing:**

- Debouncing ensures that a function is not executed until after a certain amount of time has passed since the last invocation of the function.
- Useful for scenarios where you want to wait for a pause in events before triggering a function.

#### Use Cases for Throttling and Debouncing

**Throttling Use Case:**

```javascript
// Throttle a function to execute at most once every 200 milliseconds
const throttledFunction = throttle(myFunction, 200);

// Example usage (e.g., handling scroll events)
window.addEventListener('scroll', throttledFunction);
```

**Debouncing Use Case:**

```javascript
// Debounce a function to execute only after 300 milliseconds of inactivity
const debouncedFunction = debounce(myFunction, 300);

// Example usage (e.g., handling input events)
inputElement.addEventListener('input', debouncedFunction);
```

### 5.1 Shared Memory and Synchronization

#### 5.1 SharedArrayBuffer

#### Introduction to SharedArrayBuffer for Shared Memory

`SharedArrayBuffer` is an object that represents a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer, similar to `ArrayBuffer`. However, `SharedArrayBuffer` is designed to be shared among multiple workers or threads.

```javascript
// Main Thread or Worker
const sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(16); // 16 bytes

// Accessing the shared memory
const intArray = new Int32Array(sharedBuffer);
intArray[0] = 42;
```

#### Atomics and Atomic Operations for Synchronization

`Atomics` provides atomic operations to ensure that operations on shared memory are executed atomically, without interruption.

```javascript
// Worker
onmessage = (event) => {
  const sharedBuffer = event.data;
  const intArray = new Int32Array(sharedBuffer);

  // Atomic operation (add 1 to the value at index 0)
  Atomics.add(intArray, 0, 1);

  // Send back the modified shared memory
  postMessage(sharedBuffer);
};
```

### 5.2 Locks and Semaphores

#### Overview of Locks and Semaphores for Managing Access to Shared Resources

**Locks:**

- A lock is a synchronization mechanism used to enforce exclusive access to a shared resource. Only one thread can hold the lock at a time.

**Semaphores:**

- A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that controls access to a shared resource with a counter. It can allow multiple threads to access the resource simultaneously up to a certain limit.

#### Implementing Locks and Semaphores in JavaScript

**Lock Implementation:**

```javascript
class Lock {
  constructor() {
    this.isLocked = false;
  }

  acquire() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      const attemptAcquire = () => {
        if (!this.isLocked) {
          this.isLocked = true;
          resolve();
        } else {
          setTimeout(attemptAcquire, 10);
        }
      };

      attemptAcquire();
    });
  }

  release() {
    this.isLocked = false;
  }
}
```

**Semaphore Implementation:**

```javascript
class Semaphore {
  constructor(initialCount) {
    this.count = initialCount;
    this.waitQueue = [];
  }

  acquire() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      const attemptAcquire = () => {
        if (this.count > 0) {
          this.count--;
          resolve();
        } else {
          this.waitQueue.push(resolve);
        }
      };

      attemptAcquire();
    });
  }

  release() {
    if (this.waitQueue.length > 0) {
      const resolve = this.waitQueue.shift();
      resolve();
    } else {
      this.count++;
    }
  }
}
```

These implementations demonstrate a basic lock and semaphore in JavaScript. Locks and semaphores are useful for managing access to shared resources in a concurrent environment, preventing race conditions.
