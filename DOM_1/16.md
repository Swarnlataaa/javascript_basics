### 3.2 Web Workers

#### Creating a Web Worker and Communicating with the Main Thread

Web Workers allow for concurrent execution in the background, separate from the main thread. They can be used to perform tasks without blocking the UI.

**main.js (Main Thread):**

```javascript
// Creating a Web Worker
const myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');

// Sending a message to the Worker
myWorker.postMessage('Hello from the main thread!');

// Handling messages from the Worker
myWorker.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Message received from worker:', event.data);
};
```

**worker.js (Web Worker):**

```javascript
// Handling messages from the main thread
onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Message received in worker:', event.data);

  // Sending a message back to the main thread
  postMessage('Hello from the worker!');
};
```

This example demonstrates how to create a Web Worker, send a message from the main thread to the worker, and handle messages received from the worker.

#### Handling Messages and Data Transfer between the Main Thread and a Web Worker

Communication between the main thread and a Web Worker happens through the `postMessage` method and the `onmessage` event.

**main.js (Main Thread):**

```javascript
// Creating a Web Worker
const myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');

// Sending data to the Worker
const dataToSend = { message: 'Data from main thread', value: 42 };
myWorker.postMessage(dataToSend);

// Handling messages from the Worker
myWorker.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Message received from worker:', event.data);
};
```

**worker.js (Web Worker):**

```javascript
// Handling messages from the main thread
onmessage = (event) => {
  const receivedData = event.data;
  console.log('Data received in worker:', receivedData);

  // Sending data back to the main thread
  postMessage({ message: 'Data from worker', value: receivedData.value * 2 });
};
```

This example demonstrates how to send and receive complex data between the main thread and a Web Worker.

### 3.3 Shared Workers

#### Understanding Shared Workers for Shared State among Multiple Browsing Contexts

Shared Workers allow multiple browsing contexts (e.g., tabs or iframes) to communicate with a single instance of a Web Worker. They share a common state, making them suitable for scenarios where multiple parts of an application need to coordinate.

**sharedWorker.js (Shared Worker):**

```javascript
// Handling messages from multiple browsing contexts
onconnect = (event) => {
  const port = event.ports[0];

  port.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = event.data;
    console.log('Data received in shared worker:', data);

    // Processing data and sending it back to the browsing context
    const result = data.value * 2;
    port.postMessage({ message: 'Data from shared worker', result });
  };
};
```

In this example, the `onconnect` event is used to handle connections from multiple browsing contexts, and each context communicates through its dedicated port.

### 4.1 Threading Patterns in JavaScript

#### Introduction to Parallelism and Concurrency

Parallelism and concurrency involve executing multiple tasks simultaneously. In JavaScript, parallelism is often achieved through Web Workers, while concurrency refers to managing multiple tasks within a single thread.

#### Patterns for Handling Concurrent Tasks

Common patterns for handling concurrent tasks include:

1. **Parallel Execution:**
   - Performing multiple tasks simultaneously, typically using Web Workers.

2. **Asynchronous Callbacks:**
   - Using callbacks to handle asynchronous operations.

3. **Promises and Async/Await:**
   - Utilizing promises and async/await for more structured asynchronous programming.

### 4.2 Producer-Consumer Pattern

#### Implementing the Producer-Consumer Pattern for Task Processing

The producer-consumer pattern involves a producer that generates tasks and a consumer that processes those tasks. It's commonly used in scenarios where tasks need to be offloaded to a separate thread.

```javascript
// Example: Producer-Consumer Pattern
class TaskQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = [];
    this.workers = [];

    // Create worker threads
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
      worker.onmessage = (event) => this.handleTaskCompletion(event.data);
      this.workers.push(worker);
    }
  }

  enqueueTask(task) {
    this.queue.push(task);
    this.processQueue();
  }

  processQueue() {
    if (this.queue.length > 0) {
      const task = this.queue.shift();
      const availableWorker = this.workers.find((worker) => !worker.busy);

      if (availableWorker) {
        availableWorker.busy = true;
        availableWorker.postMessage(task);
      } else {
        this.queue.unshift(task);
      }
    }
  }

  handleTaskCompletion(result) {
    // Process the result and free up the worker
    console.log('Task completed:', result);
    this.workers.find((
